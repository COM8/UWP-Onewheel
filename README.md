# UWP-Onewheel
A simple UWP [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/) companion App for all of those who are still sticking to their Windows Phones (like me ;D)
or just want something to tweak some settings for their Onewheel on a Windows 10 UWP device.

**This App is far from being perfect!**
If you want to help, feel free to do so. Help is always appreciated ðŸ¥“.

NOTE: UWP-Onewheel is not endorsed by or affiliated with Future Motion in any way.

## Supported boards:
* Onewheel+ (`Andromeda`, `Gemini`)
* All other boards and firmware revisions are **not** tested. [Let me know](https://github.com/COM8/UWP-Onewheel/issues) if you got one and UWP-Onewheel works with it!

### A note about the Gemini firmware version:
Since the Gemini firmware revision **Future Motion** added a challenge response mechanism for unlocking and accessing to the board.
* If you are interested in the process that was required to figure out how it works, read on [here](https://github.com/ponewheel/android-ponewheel/issues/86).
* [Here](https://github.com/ponewheel/android-ponewheel/issues/86#issuecomment-441448257) you can find the steps required to unlock the Onewheel and keep it unlocked.
* [Here](https://github.com/COM8/UWP-Onewheel/blob/master/OnewheelBluetooth/Classes/OnewheelUnlockHelper.cs) you can find the UWP-Onewheel implementation for it.
